browse into the /boot/ folderr of the microsd after writing Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto it.
```
sudo touch wpa_supplicant.conf
sudo touch ssh
```
Create a new file in `/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf` in the micro sd card, and copy the following text in it:
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="yourswifisid"
    scan_ssid=1
    psk="yourwifipassword"
   key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
make sure to replace your own wifi ssid and password in there. Then simply put the microsd into the raspberry pi and power it up.
To ssh into it:


9. Enable ssh:
```
sudo raspi-config
3
P2
YES
Finish
```
10. Get the ip address over ethernet of the Raspberry Pi while you're in the raspberry by typing into the Raspberry Pi CLI:
```
hostname -I
```
Which returns something like:
11.12.13.145

11. Get the account name of the raspberry pi:
```
whoami
```
12. The default password is `raspberry`.

11. Click update and install updates
12. Reboot the device
13. Then when the keyboard does not work anymore, ssh into it.
```
ssh pi@11.12.13.145
pi@11.12.13.145's password: 
```
