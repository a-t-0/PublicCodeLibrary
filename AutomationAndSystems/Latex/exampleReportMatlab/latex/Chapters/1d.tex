\section{Horshoe Orbit}\label{sec:1d}
To find the initial conditions for the asteroid in a horseshoe orbit, one can initialise the orbit without a velocity, in the vicinity of L3. The coordinates of L3 for the given configuration, are: $[-1,000, 0]$\cite{lecture_notes}.
A time-span of 500000 iterations was used. This results in the following horseshoe orbit:
