# Create new UDA that contains estimated duration of task:

task config uda.estimate.type duration
task config uda.estimate.label Est

# Learn how to enter the value of type duration:

For longer times than a day, you enter: P (remember as: Period)
	P3D	Three days.
	P1000D	One thousand days.
	P2M	Two months. This is an imprecise value.
	P2M3D	Two months and three days. This is an imprecise value.
	P1Y	One year. This is an imprecise value.
	P1Y3D	One year and three days. This is an imprecise value.
	P1Y2M	One year and two months. This is an imprecise value.
	P1Y2M3D	One year, two months and three days. This is an imprecise value.
If you are talking anything under a day you use: PT. (Remember as: PeriodTime) 
	PT50S	Fifty seconds.
	PT40M	Forty minutes.
	PT40M50S	Forty minutes and fifty seconds.
	PT12H	Twelve hours.
	PT12H50S	Twelve hours and fifty seconds.
	PT12H40M	Twelve hours and forty minutes.
	PT12H40M50S	Twelve hours, forty minutes and fifty seconds.

If you combine periods (equal to or longer) than a day, with times shorter than a day:
P1Y2M3DT12H40M50S	One year, two months, three days, twelve hours, forty minutes and fifty seconds. This is an imprecise value.


so for 4 hours and 3 seconds you add:
PT04M03S
or:
PT4M3S

The complete command could look like:
task add estimate:PT04M03S This is a test for the duration
or:
task add estimate:PT4M3S This is a test for the duration
INVALID:
task add Est:PT04M03S This is a test for the duration

Next you can change your custom report to include the estimate in it's overview:

task config report.nice0.description Custom sorted list of all tasks
task config report.nice0.columns     id,depends,due,priority,urgency,estimate,project,recur,tags,description,start");
task config report.nice0.labels      id,dep,due,prio,urgy,est,proj,again,tag, descr,start");
task config report.nice0.sort        cSort+");
task config report.nice0.filter      status:pending");
