To find and replace everything in a line that is located left of of a substring:
0. Open the file in notepadd++
1. Press ctrl+H to replace
2. Example line:
task add due:2019-09-17 priority:M proj:uni.astro exam date=2001-01-08 exercise 4-1 weight=25 topic=Inertial reference frame lect.topic=reference frames. orbital elements. coordinate systems
3. Example substring:lect.topic=
4. In the replace window, in "Search mode" click: "Regular Expressions" 
5. In the search bar type:.*lect\.topic=
5.a Meaning: I don't know what the dot means, normally it means: "Any single character"
5.b Meaning: The star is a wildcard for: "Any (multiple) characters", but it requires the dot infront of it to mean: "any characters left of"
5.c Meaning: The \ in lect\.topic is there to "Escape" the dot character. Escape means, do not interpret the special meaning that a regular expression gave to the dot symbol. (The dot symbol is actually a command for the regular expression search machine.)
6. Then in the "Replace with:" bar type nothing if you just want to delete it, or something you want to replace that search with. 
6.a (Tip, open tab marks and click mark all to see what your regular expression search term found before you do a replace.)
7. click replace all.
