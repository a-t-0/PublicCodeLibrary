Hi, This script lets you scroll in Windows windows, such as command and "Windows Console", 
where the page down, arrow down and/or up etc don't work.

0. Install Autohotkey
1.a (Place a shortcut to Scrolling_windows_console.ahk in:
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
1.b repeat for altUp if you still want to "move a folder up in explorer with your keyboard"
so that you can allways scroll like that without having to manually open the script.)
2. Open Scrolling_windows_console.ahk
3. It sends the mouse wheel scroll up command if you press: alt+up
4. It sends the mouse wheel scroll down command if you press: alt+down

Note: Originally alt+up means go one folder up, in Windows 10, so now that you remapped that function for scrolling,
you can re-enable that function by mapping alt+up to alt+/ 
I think the scrolling is more intuitive and the / is still pretty close to the arrows when navigating explorer.
