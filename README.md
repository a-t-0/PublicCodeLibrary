Hi, this contains convenient scripts to (mainly) automate or improve little parts of life, enjoy!

Notes:

0. Often I will sacrifice generality/technical correctness in explenations for the sake of being practical and keeping it simple. 
0.1 That means, if some "readme" says something "is", it is not an absolute truth, 
    it is just how I defined something in that specific context.
    
1. Also, some explanations might be faulty as they are mainly there to force myself to develop an understanding of what I am working with,
    in that process I might interpret information at the boundaries of my knowledge incorrect or negelect nuances.
